–title ：Computational Process Organization lab1
–group name and list of group members : Group 11  member1:Tong wei    member2:Gao Qingyang
–laboratory work number : 1
– variant description : variant 3  Set based on binary-tree
–– synopsis : For each version of a library (mutable and immutable) you should implement the following features:
• Add a new element (lst.add(3), cons(lst, 3)) 
• Remove an element by value (lst.remove(3), remove(lst, 3)) 
• Size (lst.size(), size(lst)), member, reverse (if applicable), intersection
• Conversion from/to built-in list (you should avoid of usage these function into your library):
– from (lst.from_list([12, 99, 37]), from_list([12, 99, 37])) – to (lst.to_list(), to_list(lst)).
• Find element by specific predicate
• Filter data structure by specific predicate
• Map structure by specific function (lst.map(increment), map
• Reduce – process structure elements to build a return value by specific functions (lst.reduce(sum),
reduce
• Data structure should be an iterator 
– for the mutable version in Python style 
– for the immutable version by closure 
• Data structure should be a monoid and implement mempty and mconcat.
–contribution summary for each group member : Gao qingyang for immutable part , Tong Wei for mutable part.
–explanation of taken design decisions and analysis : First , we defined the Node Class and Tree Class .
                                                                                 Second ,we defined the functions about add(),delete(),size() and so on.
                                                                                 Third,we write test code to test program.
–work demonstration : 1.Using the 'pycharm' to program the python files which are about the binary-tree based mutable and immutable.
                                    2.Using the 'pycharm' to program the test files.
                                    3.By using cmd terminal and python to  run the test files.
                                    4.Uploading the files and figures to github.   
                                 
–conclusion : From this lab,we learned about the difference the mutable and immutable binary-tree. 
                     And this lab improved our programming ability and enhanced our sense of teamwork.
                     Meanwhile,we also found shortcomings.Such as some design methods may be unreasonable,
                     slow programming progress and so on.But we believe we can overcome these weaknesses in the 
                     future labs.
